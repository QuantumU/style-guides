# Python Packaging

The following guide is to simplify the process of creating a python
package.  We currently recommend using the [STScI cookie cutter
template package](https://github.com/spacetelescope/stsci-package-template/tree/stsci-cookiecutter).  
This is a modified version of the [Astropy
Template Package](https://github.com/astropy/package-template) that
includes a number of features that make it easier to set up, install,
and maintain your package while also having the STScI branding,
license, and Code of Conduct as outlined in the [guide for github
repositories](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/blob/master/guides/github-repositories.md).
This includes the infrastructure to set up the automated testing and
documentation.

The following steps will allow the creation of astropy affiliated
packages compatible with the STScI requirements.  However, this might
not always be appropriate for each package and we currently do not
recommend existing packages update to these standards.


## Do you need a new python package?

There already is a large existing ecosystem of python libraries with a
wealth of different libraries for astronomy (see the [astropy
affiliated package](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/) for some
examples) as well as packages in the
[spacetelescope](https://github.com/spacetelescope) organization.
While not required, it is recommended to make a contribution to one of
these packages rather than creating a new one.  For example, some of
the following these packages may be good places to contribute the
code:

* General astronomy related functionality?  Have you consider contributing to astropy?
* Access to a database or a catalog?   This would be a good fit for astroquery!
* Spectral tools?   Have you considered specutils or specviz? 
* Analysis tools for an HST instrument?  Consider contributing to one of the HST tools packages like
* Will this be useful for JWST?  Consider contribute to the JWST library.
 
This list is hardly exhaustive, but provides an example of where to
contribute code.  If unsure, opening an issue in a repository to ask
is a very good way to find out if it is appropriate to contribute the
new functionality there.  Nonetheless, there might be times that it is
useful to create your own repository for new functionality or to test
something prior to merging it into a larger package and as such, there
will be a need to create a new package.


## Setting up a repository for your package

Prior to setting up your repository, it is strongly recommended to
google potential names.  If it already exists consider choosing a
different name (or contributing to that package if appropriate).  If
the repository acronym can have offensive meanings in other contexts,
try something different.  It is also useful to check GitHub and PyPi
for potential conflicts as well.

### GitHub vs GitLab

Following [STScI policy on source code
control](https://innerspace.stsci.edu/display/isec/Source+Code+Control),
the decision tree on where to host code is the following:

* Is it ITAR protected?  Then host it on internal git ITAR server. 
* Is it functional work?   Then it must be hosted on the STScI GitLab solution or the `spacetelescope` organization on GitHub
* Will it have external collaborators?  Then it is recommended to host it on the `spacetelescope` organization on GitHub

Code hosted on GitHub should follow the [STScI GitHub
Policy](https://innerspace.stsci.edu/display/isec/GitHub).


### Creating an new repository  

For GitHub:

Open a Service Now ticket requesting a new repository.  The ticket
should include the following information:

* Name of the repository
* Short description of the purpose of the repository
* If the repository should be public or private
* If applicable, any teams associated with the repository or other
individuals that should have access to it

For Gitlab:

After authenticating on Gitlab, the user should be able to create
their own new repository.


### Create a new package

To create a new package, we recommend the following steps.  These make
use the
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
package to quickly create a basic package with the infrastructure
needed for coding, testing, and documentation.

1.  Install the cookie cutter package

The cookiecutter package can either be installed using `pip`:
```pip install cookiecutter gitpython```

or `conda`:

```conda install  -c conda-forge cookiecutter gitpython```

2. Run cookiecutter using the STScI package template:
```
cookiecutter https://github.com/spacetelescope/stsci-package-template --checkout stsci-cookiecutter
```

The code will prompt for answers to several questions.  Other than the
repository name and github project, the default answer will be
sufficient in most cases.

3.  Set up continuous integration

Register your package on https://travis-ci.org and modify the
.travis.yml file to your needs. The default .travis.yml file contains
a large number of builds, against various versions of Python, Astropy,
and numpy, and you should choose the ones relevant to your
project. Full documentation of the .travis.yml file can be found on
the Travis CI website.


4.  Set up read the docs

If you want the documentation for your project to be hosted by Read
the Docs, then you need to setup an account there. The following
entries in `Advanced Settings` for your package on Read the Docs
should work:

* Select Install your project inside a virtualenv using setup.py install
* Edit .rtd-environment.yml with your package requirements (this file is used by conda on RTD to install the requirements for your package).
* Activate Give the virtual environment access to the global site-packages dir.
* All other settings can stay on their default value.


Once these steps have been completed, the package should be ready for
further development with testing and documentation in place.
